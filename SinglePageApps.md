A single-page application (SPA) is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, rather than the default method of loading entire new pages. Instead of reloading the whole page for each user interaction, SPAs update only the necessary parts, resulting in a faster, more responsive user experience. [1, 2]  
Here's a more detailed explanation: 

• How it works: SPAs load a single HTML page and then dynamically update that page as the user interacts with it. This is typically achieved through JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, which handle the client-side logic and communication with the server. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
• Key features: 
	• No page reloads: Users don't experience the typical page refresh when navigating different sections of the application. [1, 7]  
	• Faster performance: By minimizing data transfer and only updating content that has changed, SPAs offer a quicker, more fluid user experience. [1, 3]  
	• Seamless user experience: SPAs mimic the behavior of native desktop applications, providing a more intuitive and engaging user experience. [1, 8]  

• Examples: Popular examples of SPAs include Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, and many more. [6, 7]  
• Traditional web applications vs. SPAs: Traditional web applications reload the entire page for every user action, while SPAs update only the necessary parts of the page, leading to improved performance and a more interactive experience. [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]
